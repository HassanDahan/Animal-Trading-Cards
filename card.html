			<p>Bottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds, whistles,
				and body language. Examples of body language include leaping out of the
				water, snapping jaws, slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads.
				Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group, and
				alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food.
